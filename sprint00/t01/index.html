                can decide whether said power is a curse or blessing. It
                transformed the Red Skull into the Stonekeeper and granted him
                wisdom, immortality and the power to know all about those who
                journey there but also could prevent him from leaving Vormir as
                long as the Stone remains there.</td>

                be it on a small or massive scale, notably to turn back something
                a previous state, to accelerate its time in order to apply changes
                that have not happened yet, or to lock it in a time loop, resetting
                its state until the wielder stops its effect. It appeared skilled
                sorcerers, or perhaps users of powers from the Dark Dimension could
                to an extent subtract themselves to the effects of the stone, stopping
                e time-reversal affecting oneself or detecting one was stuck in a time

                the dawn of the superhero age, attracting the attention of forces such as
                Red Skull and Thanos, both of whom sought to use the Tesseract's power for
                eir own sinister intents. It is later revealed that the cube is a containment
                unit built around the actual Infinity Stone so that it could be somewhat
                safely handled and controlled.</td>

                bending them to the will of the user, as well as project the user's consciousness to a higher plane
                of existence. The stone was also said to greatly increase the intelligence of those capable of wielding
                it, as shown in the cases of Loki and Wolfgang von Strucker</td>

                it to manipulate energy, which, when used at full potential, has enough power to obliterate an entire
                planet when unleashed. This stone was sought by Thanos, who tasked Ronan the Accuser to acquire it from
                the dead planet of Morag, in exchange for destroying Xandar.</td>
