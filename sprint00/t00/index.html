<h2>Whats makes a super hero?</h2>
<p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
    So in order to be a superhero, <strong> need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess </strong>and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br> For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
